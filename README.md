## About me
My experience as a business assistant in an EdTech project focused on IT training has provided me with a deep understanding and knowledge of the IT industry. I have gained valuable insights into the field of software testing and the dynamic nature of IT, and I really enjoy it!

<i>Data passionate, continuous learning and curious soul. Based in Poland but available to work worldwide.</i>

## My experience
My previous job was closely related to IT. I have worked in EdTech on the development of IT courses in frontend, backend and testing, where I was responsible for:
- managing the educational process, structuring materials;
- creating educational content and innovative internship projects;
- processing customer experience;
- operating business workflows;

Also we have developed Internship Program for our students:

This project was conceived as a small startup for student practice. At the beginning of the project's development, I served as a project manager, creating and managing project documentation, collaborating with developers and designers, I was responsible for:
- tracking and monitor project tasks;
- preparing regular project status reports for senior management;
- creating project documentation;
- managing project specifications and test documentation;
- conducting functional tests;

In a small team of 3 people, we brought the project to its MVP stage, at which point we onboarded students for further work and practical experience. It was a source of genuine pleasure for me, which has also made me interested especcialy in the QA path.
