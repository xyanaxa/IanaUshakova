## üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About me
My experience as a business assistant in an EdTech project focused on IT training has provided me with a deep understanding and knowledge of the IT industry. I have gained valuable insights into the field of software testing and the dynamic nature of IT, and I really enjoy it! 

I believe that QA field offers exciting opportunities for innovation and growth, and I'm eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to make a meaningful impact. I want do big things, that work good and change people minds. When we have certain expectations about something, it's important that reality matches those expectations. Quality Assurance helps create conditions to ensure that a product or service actually aligns with what we expect and what's required and generally helps people live better.

In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge in the field of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have acquired through courses and self-study.

<i>Data passionate, continuous learning and curious soul. Based in Poland but available to work worldwide.</i>

## üíº My experience
My previous job was closely related to IT. I have worked in EdTech on the development of IT courses in frontend, backend and testing, where I was responsible for:
- managing the educational process, structuring materials;
- creating educational content and innovative internship projects;
- processing customer experience;
- operating business workflows;

üìå Also we have developed Internship Program for our students:

This project was conceived as a small startup for student practice. At the beginning of the project's development, I served as a project manager, creating and managing project documentation, collaborating with developers and designers, I was responsible for:
- tracking and monitor project tasks;
- preparing regular project status reports for senior management;
- creating project documentation;
- managing project specifications and test documentation;
- conducting functional tests;

In a small team of 3 people, we brought the project to its MVP stage, at which point we onboarded students for further work and practical experience. It was a source of genuine pleasure for me, which has also made me interested especcialy in the QA path.
